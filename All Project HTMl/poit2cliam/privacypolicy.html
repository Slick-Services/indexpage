                        <p><b>11. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</b></p>
                        <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and
                            conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and
                            those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.</p>
                        <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
                        <p>0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;</p>

                        <p>Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:</p>

                            want to be tracked.</p>
                        <p>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.</p>
                        <p><b>12. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</b></p>

                        <p>0.1. What personal information we have about you. If you make this request, we will return to you:</p>

                        <p>0.0.2. The categories of sources from which we collect your personal information.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>0.3. To stop selling your personal information. We don’t sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for any purpose. We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration. However, under some circumstances,
                            a transfer of personal information to a third party, or within our family of companies, without monetary consideration may be considered a “sale” under California law. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request
